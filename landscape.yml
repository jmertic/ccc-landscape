              The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the
              increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in
              applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war
              defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in
              1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. The Institute is traditionally known for its research
              and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. It is often
              cited as among the world's top universities. The "Engineers" sponsor 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England
              Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.
